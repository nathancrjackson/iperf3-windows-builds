# Iperf3 builds for Windows (using Cygwin)

This repository is for Windows builds of [https://github.com/esnet/iperf](https://github.com/esnet/iperf).

There are currently 2 versions you can download. The unmarked "standard" version which has the complete feature set of Iperf3, and the "lite" version which lacks the user authorization options and is therefore nearly half of the size.

If you would like to view license details please visit the official GitHub repo.

I have written a guide on how to compile this yourself which you can access on my website at [https://njit.io/kb/os/windows/how-to-compile-iperf3-for-windows-using-cygwin/](https://njit.io/kb/os/windows/how-to-compile-iperf3-for-windows-using-cygwin/) or failing that if my website and I disappear the page has been added to [the Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20221230052825/https://njit.io/kb/os/windows/how-to-compile-iperf3-for-windows-using-cygwin/).  
Please note: as per [the first issue raised in this repo](https://github.com/nathancrjackson/iperf3-windows-builds/issues/1) the guide currently only builds the "lite" version and will be updated in the future.
